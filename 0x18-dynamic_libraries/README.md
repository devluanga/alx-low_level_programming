In C programming, dynamic libraries, also known as shared libraries,
   are libraries that are loaded and linked at runtime rather than being statically
   linked during the compilation process.
Dynamic libraries provide a way to modularize and reuse code across multiple programs or processes.

Here are some key points about dynamic libraries in C:


	1. Compilation and linking: 
	Dynamic libraries are created by compiling source code into object files and
       	then linking those object files into a shared library file.
       	The shared library file typically has a file extension like ".so" (on Unix-like systems) or ".dll" (on Windows).

	2. Dynamic loading: Unlike static libraries that are linked with the executable at compile time,
       	dynamic libraries are loaded into memory and linked at runtime.
       	This means that the library code is not directly included in the final executable file.

	3. Code sharing: Dynamic libraries allow multiple programs to share the same code in memory.
       	This can help reduce memory usage and simplify code maintenance, as changes to the library 
	can be reflected across all programs using it without the need to recompile them.

	4. Dynamic linking: When a program is executed, 
	the dynamic linker/loader searches for the required dynamic libraries and loads them into memory.
       	The program's code then references the functions and symbols provided by the library dynamically.

	5. Symbol resolution: Dynamic libraries export symbols,
       	which are functions or variables that can be accessed by other programs. 
	Symbol resolution is the process of mapping symbols used in the program to their corresponding addresses in the loaded libraries.

	6. Platform-specific considerations: The process of working with
       	dynamic libraries can vary across different operating systems. 
	On Unix-like systems, you typically use the `dlopen()`, `dlsym()`, and
       	`dlclose()` functions to dynamically load and access symbols from shared libraries.
       	On Windows, you use functions like `LoadLibrary()`, `GetProcAddress()`, and `FreeLibrary()`.

	7. Library versioning: Dynamic libraries often support versioning mechanisms to manage
       	compatibility between different library versions.
       	This allows different programs to use the appropriate version of the library based on their requirements.


Dynamic libraries provide flexibility and modularity in C programming, allowing for code reuse, easier updates, and reduced memory usage.
They are commonly used in various applications, including large software systems, plug-in architectures, and dynamically loadable modules.
