This directory provides for all the function pointer projects


In C, a function pointer is a variable that stores the address of a function. It can be used to call the function indirectly, or to pass the function as an argument to another function. Function pointers can be very useful in certain programming scenarios, such as when implementing callbacks or event handlers.

Here's an example of how to declare a function pointer:
	int (*myFunctionPointer)(int, int);


This declares a function pointer called myFunctionPointer that points to a function that takes two integer arguments and returns an integer. You can assign a function to the pointer like this:


	int sum(int a, int b)
	{
		return a + b;
	}

	myFunctionPointer = &sum;

Now myFunctionPointer points to the sum() function, and you can call it indirectly like this:

	int result = (*myFunctionPointer)(2, 3);


This calls the sum() function with arguments 2 and 3, and stores the result in the result variable.

Function pointers can also be passed as arguments to other functions, like this:

	void printResult(int (*functionPointer)(int, int), int a, int b)
	{
		int result = (*functionPointer)(a, b);
		printf("Result: %d\n", result);
	}
	printResult(&sum, 2, 3);

This calls the printResult() function with the sum() function pointer, and prints the result of calling sum() with arguments 2 and 3.

Function pointers can be a bit tricky to work with, but they can be very powerful when used correctly.
